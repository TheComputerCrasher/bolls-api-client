# bolls-api-bash
A utility for easily accessing the [bolls.life API](https://bolls.life/api) to get specific portions of the Bible from a Bash terminal or script. Human-readable text is the default, but can be changed to raw JSON for scripting or whatever with the ```-j``` / ```--raw-json``` flag (see Usage section below).

## Dependencies
Required: ```python3```, ```curl```, and internet access.

Optional: ```jq``` (required for pretty-printing and other formatting)

## Installation
Download bolls.sh, put it wherever you'd like, and add ```source /path/to/bolls.sh``` to your .bashrc. If your terminal and/or scripts do not use Bash, you'll have to translate this script to another Shell language. 

## License
I put this under the CC0 (public domain) license since the code was written by AI. Only the ideas and a couple small edits are truly mine. Feel free to use this in your own projects if you would like (especially the people at [bolls.life](https://bolls.life))!

  ```-p``` / ```--parallel``` ```<translations> <book> <chapter> <verse(s)>``` OR ```--parallel <JSON array or file>```
