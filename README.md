# Bolls API command-line client
A utility for easily accessing the [bolls.life API](https://bolls.life/api/) to get specific portions of the Bible from a CLI. Human-readable text is the default, but can be changed to raw JSON for scripting or whatever with the ```-j``` / ```--raw-json``` flag (see [Usage](README.md#Usage) section below). 

## Dependencies
[```python3```](https://github.com/python/cpython) (obviously), [```pycurl```](https://pypi.org/project/pycurl/), [```jq```](https://pypi.org/project/jq/), and internet access.

In theory, the script should also work if you are running the site locally as per the [official docs](https://github.com/Bolls-Bible/bain/blob/master/docs/LOCAL_DEV_WITH_DOCKER_COMPOSER.md). You *should* just have to change ```BASE_URL``` in line 23 from https://bolls.life to https://bolls.local, but I have not tested this. 

## Installation
Download [bolls.py](bolls.py), put it wherever you'd like, and run ```python3 /path/to/bolls.py``` ```<subcommands>```. I recommend putting this under an alias like ```bolls``` (which is what I use for the example commands). 

## Packaging?
If you want to package this script for your own OS or PyPI or whatever, that's great, but I will not be doing so. Besides, this is a CLI-only program and pretty much everything supports Python fairly easily, so I recommend the installation method above unless you want to share your packaged version with the rest of the internet. 

## License
I (TheComputerCrasher) put this under the CC0 (public domain) license since the code was written by Codex-5.2 (generative AI). Only the ideas, some small edits, and this README are truly mine. Feel free to use this in your own projects if you would like (especially the people at [bolls.life](https://bolls.life/))! Credit is appreciated but not required, as per the CC0 licence. 

## Usage
(taken from ```bolls --help```)

Command flags (choose one):

* ```-h``` / ```--help``` - Show this help page

* ```-t``` / ```--list-translations``` - List all available Bible translations

* ```-d``` / ```--list-dictionaries``` - List all available Hebrew/Greek dictionaries

* ```-b``` / ```--books``` ```<translation>``` - List all books of a chosen translation

* ```-v``` / ```--verse``` ```<translation(s)> <book> <chapter>:<verse(s)>``` - Get one or multiple verses from the same chapter

* ```-c``` / ```--chapter``` ```<translation(s)> <book> <chapter>``` - Get an entire chapter

* ```-r``` / ```--random``` ```<translation>``` - Get a random verse

* ```-D``` / ```--define``` ```<dictionary> <Hebrew/Greek word>``` - Get definitions for a Hebrew or Greek word

* ```-s``` / ```--search <translation> <search term> [options]``` - Search verses by text

Search options (choose any amount or none):

* ```-m``` / ```--match-case``` - Make search case-sensitive

* ```-w``` / ```--match-whole``` - Only search complete phrase matches (currently not working because it needs spaces)

* ```-B``` / ```--book ``` ```<book/ot/nt>``` - Search in a specific book, or in just the Old or New Testament

* ```-p``` / ```--page``` ```<#>``` - Go to a specific page of the search results

* ```-l``` / ```--page-limit``` ```<#>``` - Limits the number of pages of search results

Notes:

* ```<book>``` can be a number or a name (case-insensitive).

* ```<translation>``` must be the abbreviation, not the full name (case-insensitive).

* ```<verse(s)>``` can be a single number, multiple numbers in a list (e.g. '1,5,9'), or a range (e.g. 13-17).

Modifier flags (choose one or none):

* ```-j``` / ```--raw-json``` - Disable formatting

* ```-i``` / ```--include-all``` - Include everything (verse id, translation, book number, etc.) in -v and -c

* ```-C``` / ```--include-comments``` - Include commentary in -c

Examples:
```
bolls --translations
bolls -d
bolls --books AMP
bolls -r msg -j
bolls --chapter esv Genesis 1
bolls -c esv 1 1 -j
bolls --chapter nlt,nkjv genesis 1
bolls -v NIV Luke 2:15-17
bolls --verse niv,nkjv genesis 1:1-3 -C
bolls -s ylt -m -w -l 3 -P 1 Jesus wept
bolls --search YLT --match-case --match-whole --page-limit 3 --page 1 Jesus wept
bolls -D BDBT אֹ֑ור
```

## TODO
* Figure out how this would work for anyone running bolls.life locally as per the [official docs](https://github.com/Bolls-Bible/bain/blob/master/docs/LOCAL_DEV_WITH_DOCKER_COMPOSER.md)
* Maybe allow -v to get verses from multiple chapters at once
* Maybe figure out how I want to share this with the internet, but this is kinda a niche project and anyone can freely edit if they find it so may not be worth it
