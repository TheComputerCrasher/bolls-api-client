# Bolls API - command-line client
A utility for easily accessing the [bolls.life API](https://bolls.life/api/) to get specific portions of the Bible from a Bash terminal or script. Human-readable text is the default, but can be changed to raw JSON for scripting or whatever with the ```-j``` / ```--raw-json``` flag (see Usage section below).

## Dependencies
Required: ```python3```, ```curl```, and internet access.

Optional (but recommended): ```jq``` (required for pretty-printing and formatting the JSON the API provides)

## Installation
Download bolls.sh, put it wherever you'd like, and add ```source /path/to/bolls.sh``` to your .bashrc. If your terminal and/or scripts do not use Bash, you'll have to translate this script to the Shell language you use. 

It'd probably be better if this was all Python or another non-Shell language, but when I started the project I didn't need any fancy Python stuff. I may consider changing it once all the major features I want are finished.

## License
I put this under the CC0 (public domain) license since the code was written by Codex-5.2 (generative AI). Only the ideas and some small edits are truly mine. Feel free to use this in your own projects if you would like (especially the people at [bolls.life](https://bolls.life/))! Credit is appreciated but not required, as per the CC0 licence.

  ```-p``` / ```--parallel``` ```<translations> <book> <chapter> <verse(s)>``` OR ```--parallel``` ```<JSON array or file>``` - Compare one or multiple verses from the same chapter across translations (the translations must have the same books, or this will compare different verses)

  Search options:

  ```--match-case``` ```<true/false>```

  ```--match-whole-word``` ```<true/false>```

  ```-r``` / ```--random``` ```<translation>``` - Get a random verse

  ```-f``` / ```--define``` ```<dictionary> <Hebrew/Greek word>``` - Get definitions for a Hebrew or Greek word

  ```-i``` / ```--include-all``` - Include all JSON keys in -v and -c

  ```-n``` / ```--no-comment``` - Remove commentary from -c

## TODO
* Maybe translate into Python with [```pycurl```](https://pypi.org/project/pycurl/) and [```jq```](https://pypi.org/project/jq/)
