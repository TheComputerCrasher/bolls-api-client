# Bolls API command-line client
A utility for easily accessing the [bolls.life API]([https://bolls.life/api/](https://github.com/Bolls-Bible/bain/blob/master/docs/API.md)) to get specific portions of the Bible from a CLI. Human-readable text is the default, but can be changed to raw JSON for scripting or whatever with the ```-j``` / ```--raw-json``` flag (see [Usage](README.md#Usage) section below). 

This script has only been tested on English translations, but it should be general enough that it works with other languages as well.

## Dependencies
[```python3```](https://github.com/python/cpython) (obviously), [```pycurl```](https://pypi.org/project/pycurl/), [```jq```](https://pypi.org/project/jq/), and either internet access or a [local copy of bolls.life](https://github.com/Bolls-Bible/bain/blob/master/docs/LOCAL_DEV_WITH_DOCKER_COMPOSER.md). If using the latter, change BASE_URL in line 23 to https://bolls.local or http://localhost:8080 or whatever.

## Installation
Download [bolls.py](bolls.py), put it wherever you'd like, and run ```python3 /path/to/bolls.py``` ```<subcommands>```. I recommend putting this under an alias like ```bolls``` (which is what I use for the example commands). 

## Packaging?
If you want to package this script for your own OS or PyPI or whatever, that's great, but I will not be doing so. Besides, this is a CLI-only program and pretty much everything supports Python fairly easily, so I recommend the installation method above unless you want to share your packaged version with the rest of the internet. 

## License
I (TheComputerCrasher) put this under the Unilicense (public domain license) since the code was written by Codex-5.2 (generative AI). Only the ideas, some small edits, and this README are truly mine. Feel free to use this in your own projects if you would like (especially the people at [bolls.life](https://bolls.life/))! Credit is appreciated but not required, as per the Unilicense. 

## Usage
(taken from ```bolls --help```)

Command flags (choose one):

```-h``` / ```--help```
* Show this help page

```-d``` / ```--list-dictionaries```

Search options (choose any amount or none when using -s):

Notes:
* ```<book>``` can be a number or a name.
* ```<translation>``` must be the abbreviation, not the full name. Multiple translations are separated by commas.
* ```[verse(s)]``` and ```[chapter(s)]``` can be a single number, multiple numbers separated by commas (e.g. 1,5,9), or a range (e.g. 13-17).
* Use / to use multiple ```-v``` commands at once (see examples).
* In -v, omit verses to get a full chapter, and omit chapters to get the full book.

* Searches Young's Literal Translation for "Jesus wept", case-sensitive and matching the entire phrase, with a limit of 3 pages.


## TODO
* Maybe figure out how I want to share this with the internet, but this is kinda a niche project and anyone can freely edit if they find it so may not be worth it
